    "\n",
    "In this lab class you will be using data that represents the weights and lengths of male and female **Bengal tigers**. In order to build classifiers we are going to want to be able to estimate the means (i.e., averages), variances and covariance of these measurements. In order to discover the true means and variances we would have to catch and measure every one of the roughly 2,500 tigers that are thought to exist – a project that is clearly impractical. So instead, we will have to be satisfied with an **estimate** of the true mean and variance that we will generate by looking at the statistics of a small **sample** of tigers (e.g., we might catch and measure 20 animals). The need to rely on a sample is generally always going to be the case: we will be interested in the statistics of a large population, but we will have to make do with estimates derived from a smaller – often much smaller – sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The notebook is split into two parts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Part 1** we will be using Python to find out what happens when we try to compute estimates of statistics using small samples. We will see how the reliability of the estimates improves as the sample size increases. We will also see how estimates of variance and covariance can be biased (i.e., systematically too small or too large) if we do not handle the sample correctly.\n",

    "**Part 2 consists of some Python programming challenges.**\n",

    "(Why does the sample variance under-estimate the true variance? Informal explanation: The point to remember is that the variance is the average squared distance of points from the true mean. However, if we have a sample, we can only form an *estimate* of the mean. So when we estimate variance we end up computing the distance of points to the estimated mean not the true mean. The estimated mean is (by definition) going to lie at the centre of our sample of points and will therefore always be closer on average to the sample points than the true mean would have been. This is seen clearly by taking the extreme case of a sample size of 1. For a single point the sample mean will always be the sample itself, i.e. the distance to the sample mean is 0 so the sample variance is 0 - which is clearly a severe underestimate of the true variance.)"
